# Request Reindex of SharePoint User Profile Properties

## Summary

This function, Request-PnPReindexUserProfile, triggers a full crawl of each user's profile properties. The index should run in the next couple of hours.

![Example Screenshot](assets/example.png)

## Implementation
Save this script to a PSM1 module file, like reindexusers.psm1. Then import the module file with Import-Module:
```powershell

Import-Module reindexusers.psm1 -Verbose

```
The -Verbose switch lists the functions that are imported.

Once the module is imported the function Request-PnPReindexUserProfile will be loaded and ready to use.

function Request-PnPReindexUserProfile {

.SYNOPSIS
Script to trigger re-indexing of all user profiles

.Description
If you perform search schema mappings after profiles exist you have to update the last modified time on a profile for it to be re-indexed.
This script ensures all profiles are updated with a new time stamp. Once the import job completes allow 4-24h for profiles to be updated in search.

If used in automation replace Connect-PnPOnline with something which works for you. 

A temp file will be created on the file system where you execute the command. That temp file will also be uploaded to the "Shared Documents" library in the site you pass in the -url parameter. The account you connect with must have write permission to the -url site and have the SharePoint Admin role in the tenant. 

.Parameter url
The site you will use to host the import file. Can be any site you have write access to. DO NOT use the admin site.

.PARAMETER DocumentLibrary
If you don't want the temporary file uploaded to the Shared Documents library of your site, specific a different library here. Use Get-PnPList after connecting to get a list of the available document libraries. 

.Example 
Request-PnPReindexUserProfile -url https://contoso.sharepoint.com

Request-PnPReindexUserProfile -url https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/IT -DocumentLibrary Foo
