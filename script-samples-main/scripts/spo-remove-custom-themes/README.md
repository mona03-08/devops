## Summary

Have you been creating a lot of beautiful themes lately and testing them in your dev tenant, but donâ€™t want to keep them anymore? If yes, then this PowerShell script is for you.
 
 
# [PnP PowerShell](#tab/pnpps)

```powershell

$SPOAdmminSite = 'https://contoso-admin.sharepoint.com'
$themesToKeep = "Contoso Explorers", "Multicolored theme"

Connect-PnPOnline -Url $SPOAdmminSite -Interactive
$themes = Get-PnPTenantTheme
$themes = $themes | where {-not ($themesToKeep -contains $_.name)}
$themes | Format-Table name
if ($themes.Count -eq 0) { break }
Read-Host -Prompt "Press Enter to start deleting $($themes.Count) themes (CTRL + C to exit)"
$progress = 0
$total = $themes.Count
foreach ($theme in $themes)
{
  $progress++
  write-host $progress / $total":" $theme.name
