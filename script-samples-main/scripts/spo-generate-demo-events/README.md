# Generate Demo Events for SharePoint Events List

## Summary

This sample script generates demo events for the SharePoint Events List within a modern site. This uses a CSV to load sample events that includes, titles, descriptions, start, end times, category. The script will use the current date and add days to the events from the CSV file to create example events in the future relative to the current date.

This scenario shows how to bulk add events and could be modified to bulk load events into the SharePoint Events List.

> [!Note]
> The script does not include the imagery shown in the screenshot, I have update stock images as its very quick to do.
> In addition, the location does not resolve the longitude and latitude coordinates.
